SDLC

what is SDLC?
 
---sdlc stands for software development life cycle it contains seven phases

	1.Requirements gathering: Gathering the needs and expectations of stakeholders for the software projects
	2.Analysis:       evaluate the gathering requirements and define clear development plan
	3.Design  :      create a blueprint for the software,detailing architecture,components and interfaces
	4.Implementation: develop the code based on the design
	5.Testing: fix the issues or error any occur in code
	6.Deployment: delivering the product to the clients using some service like cloud or aws
	7.Maintenance: Continuously update and improve the software to fix issues and add new features.


SRS stands for Software Requirements Specification.


RUP (Rational Unified Process)phases

Inception: requirements gathering and planning
Elaboration:  analysis and design
Construction: coding/implementation
Transition: Deploy the system to the end-users.


product vs service

product is bought 

service is subscribed  example: Samsung is product ,  you can pay only once
				airtel delivers service        you can pay monthly

What is the difference between QA and QC?
	Quality Assurance

		methods, that we follow that ensures(protect) the quality of the product being developed

	Quality Control

		to find bugs, defects
		quality of the product
		quality of the process to develop the product
		quality of the quality process itself


Scrum Master
	sprint planning, 
	determining durations, and 
	outlining tasks for each cycle.

Software development life cycle (SDLC) models
   
>>>> Waterfall Model:

Linear and sequential: Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Phases: Requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Pros: Simple and easy to understand, good for projects with well-defined requirements.
Cons: Rigid, inflexible, difficult to accommodate changes.

>>>>> Agile Model:

Iterative and incremental: Development is divided into short iterations (sprints) with frequent feedback and adjustments.
Key principles: Collaboration, flexibility, customer satisfaction.
Methods: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP).
Pros: Adaptable to change, customer involvement, faster time-to-market.
Cons: Requires high team collaboration, may not be suitable for all projects.

>>>> Iterative Model:

Repetitive cycles of development and testing.
phases:Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Evaluation.
Focuses on early prototypes and continuous improvement.
Pros: Allows for early feedback and risk mitigation.
Cons: Can be time-consuming and may lead to scope creep.

>>>> Spiral Model:

Combines iterative development with risk management.
phases:Planning, Risk Analysis, Development, Evaluation.
Involves risk analysis and prototyping at each stage.
Pros: Good for complex projects with high risk.
Cons: Can be expensive and time-consuming.

>>>> V-Shaped Model:

Verification and validation are emphasized at each stage.
phases:Requirements, Design, Coding, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Acceptance Testing
Testing activities are planned in parallel with the corresponding development phase.
Pros: Emphasizes quality assurance throughout the development process.
Cons: Less flexible than iterative models.



Software Testing Types (STLC)

Software testing is a crucial part of the SDLC, ensuring(protect) the quality and reliability of the software. Here are some common types of testing:

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of the software.
Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between different components or modules.
System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Testing the software by end-users to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.
Performance Testing: Evaluating the system's performance under different workloads.
Security Testing: Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
Usability Testing: Evaluating the ease of use and user experience.
